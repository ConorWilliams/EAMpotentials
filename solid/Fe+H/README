These potential files are compatible with LAMMPS (as of Dec 20008).

Preferred potentials:
We recommend using Potential B, which performs slightly better than Potential A in our tests. You must run these with "pairstyle = eam/fs" (see LAMMPS documentation for details).

Potential A : This is based on Fe Potential 4 from Mendelev et al. (Philos Mag 11, 3977 (2003)) and fit to bulk, vacancy, and surface data from DFT.

Potential B : This is based on the Fe potential from Ackland et al. (J Phys: Condens Mat 16, S2629 (2004)) and fit to bulk, vacancy, and surface data from DFT.

"Bulk-only" potentials: These potentials were fit only to bulk and vacancy DFT data and are slightly better than Potentials A and B in their response to strain fields in bulk environments. However, these do not perform well at surfaces. Use at your own discretion! Also note that you must run these with "pairstyle = eam/alloy" (see LAMMPS documentation).

bulkA.alloy : This is based on Fe Potential 4 from Mendelev et al. [Philos Mag 11, 3977 (2003)] and fit only to bulk and vacancy data from DFT.

bulkB.alloy : This is based on the Fe potential from Ackland et al. [J Phys: Condens Mat 16, S2629 (2004)] and fit only to bulk and vacancy data from DFT.
